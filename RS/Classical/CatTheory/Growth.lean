# Moderate growth of tensor powers

The two ways of asking that the tensor powers of every object grow
at most exponentially: by the dimension of their endomorphism
algebras (`ModerateEndGrowth`, here), and by their composition
length (`ModerateLengthGrowth`, defined in `RS/Definitions.lean`).
In a semisimple category with finite-dimensional Hom-spaces the
first implies the second, because length is bounded by the
endomorphism dimension.

Length is the measure Deligne's theorem states its growth
hypothesis in; the endomorphism dimension is the measure the
envelope's rank bound supplies directly.

# Zeta series characterization

The Newton generating series `newtonHSeries t` is the unique power
series with constant term 1 satisfying the trace-zeta differential
equation `H' = S · H`, where `S = powerSumSeries t` is the shifted
power-sum series.  This file establishes the ODE-uniqueness principle
for formal power series over ℂ and applies it to characterize the
Newton series.

/-! ### ODE uniqueness for formal power series -/

/-- **ODE uniqueness for formal power series over ℂ.**
If two power series `F` and `G` both have constant term `1` and
satisfy the same first-order linear ODE `F' = S · F`, then `F = G`.

Proof: coefficient induction.  The ODE implies
`(n+1) · coeff (n+1) F = ∑_{i+j=n} coeff i S · coeff j F`;
since all coefficients up to `n` agree by the inductive hypothesis,
the sums for `F` and `G` coincide, and `(n+1) ≠ 0` in `ℂ` allows
cancellation. -/

/-! ### The Newton ODE -/

/-- The Newton generating series satisfies the trace-zeta ODE:
`d⁄dX (newtonHSeries t) = powerSumSeries t * newtonHSeries t`.
This is a re-export of `newtonH_derivative`. -/
theorem newtonH_series_ode (t : ℕ → ℂ) :
    d⁄dX ℂ (newtonHSeries t) = powerSumSeries t * newtonHSeries t :=
  newtonH_derivative t

/-! ### The zeta characterization -/

/-- Any power series with constant term 1 satisfying the trace-zeta
differential equation is the Newton series: the trace zeta function
IS the complete homogeneous generating function. -/

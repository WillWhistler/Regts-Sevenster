# Rationality of the Newton generating series

The Newton generating series of a sequence obeying a nontrivial
linear recurrence is a rational function.
`RationalityFromRecurrence.lean` produces a coprime polynomial pair
from the recurrence; here both constant terms are normalised to 1,
which is the form the trace zeta function is read in, and the
recurrence itself is supplied by hook vanishing.

# Deligne's theorem on tensor categories

`DeligneTheoremStatement`, carrying Deligne's own hypotheses with
`DeligneFibreFunctor` as its conclusion, is stated in
`RS/Definitions.lean`, together with a hypothesis-by-hypothesis
correspondence against Théorème 0.6 and §0.1 of *Catégories
tensorielles* (Moscow Math. J. **2** (2002), 227–248; see also
Ostrik, arXiv:math/0401347, Thm 2.3).  It is proved in
`RS/Classical/Deligne/`, as `RS.deligne_theorem`.

This module carries the step from the conclusion to the consumed
interface: `DeligneFibreFunctor.toPackage` forgets faithfulness and
exactness, leaving the symmetric monoidal ℂ-linear functor the
development uses (`DelignePackage`).  The conclusion is taken in
fibre-functor form rather than as the ⊗-equivalence with the
representations of a supergroup, which yields the functor by
composing with the forgetful functor.

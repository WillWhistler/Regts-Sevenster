# The Deligne fibre-functor interface

What the development actually consumes from a fibre functor.
Deligne's theorem is stated with his own hypotheses in
`DeligneTheorem.lean`, and its conclusion is
`DeligneFibreFunctor`: an exact, faithful, ℂ-linear symmetric
monoidal functor to super vector spaces.  Only the symmetric
monoidal ℂ-linear structure is used downstream, so exactness and
faithfulness are forgotten here, by
`DeligneFibreFunctor.toPackage`.  Weakening the interface weakens
what is assumed.

The package is stated over an arbitrary carrier, so it can be
instantiated at the constructed envelope; the hypotheses of the
cited theorem are discharged for that envelope in
`RS/Novel/Envelope/EnvDelignePackage.lean`.

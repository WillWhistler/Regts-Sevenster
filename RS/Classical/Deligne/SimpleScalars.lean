# The scalars of a simple algebra

For a commutative algebra object `R` whose only ideals are `⊥` and
`⊤`, multiplication by a nonzero even scalar is an isomorphism, so
the even part of the Γ-algebra of `R` is a field; and the odd part
of that Γ-algebra vanishes.

The mechanism is `RS.mulBy`: multiplication by an even scalar is a
module endomorphism of `R` (`RS.mul_comp_mulBy`), so its kernel and
its image are ideals (`RS.isIdeal_kernelSubobject_mulBy`,
`RS.isIdeal_imageSubobject_mulBy`).  Simplicity forces the kernel to
be `⊥` and the image to be `⊤`, whence the endomorphism is an
isomorphism (`RS.isIso_mulBy_of_simple`) and the preimage of the
unit inverts the scalar (`RS.exists_inverse_of_simple`).

The odd part goes the same way.  An odd element `f` acts on `R` by
`RS.gmul f (𝟙 R)`, whose image is an ideal for the same reason; an
odd element squares to zero, so that action kills its own image, and
under either alternative of simplicity the action vanishes
(`RS.hom_oddLine_eq_zero_of_simple`).

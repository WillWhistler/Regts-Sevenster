# A common extension of a family of algebras

Any small family of nonzero commutative algebras of the
ind-completion sits inside a single nonzero commutative algebra:
their tensor product.  This is the device of Deligne 2.11, which
uses it to make every object mixed and every short exact sequence
split simultaneously.

The index type is put in bijection with a well-ordered one so
that the slot order required by the tensor product is available.

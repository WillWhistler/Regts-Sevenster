# Exactness from short exact sequences

An additive functor between abelian categories that carries short
exact sequences to short exact sequences preserves finite limits and
finite colimits.  Mathlib supplies the equivalence as
`CategoryTheory.Functor.exact_tfae`, whose first and fourth entries
are exactly the hypothesis and the pair of conclusions; the general
results below are the named projections of that equivalence, and
the third of them records the intermediate entry, preservation of
homology.

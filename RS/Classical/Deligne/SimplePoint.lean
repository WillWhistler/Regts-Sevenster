# The complex point of a simple algebra

The even part of the Γ-algebra of a simple countably presented
algebra is the complex numbers and its odd part vanishes, so the
Γ-algebra has a complex point on the nose: the inverse of the
structure map, with nothing to check on the odd side.

This is the last input of the fibre functor: with a point in hand
the base change of `RS/Classical/Deligne/PointFibre.lean` lands in
finite-dimensional super vector spaces.

/-- **A simple countably presented algebra has a complex point.**
The even part is the complex numbers and the odd part vanishes, so
the point is the inverse of the structure map and the vanishing
condition is vacuous. -/

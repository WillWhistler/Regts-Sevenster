# A simple algebra splitting the tensor generator

Composing the two halves: the splitting algebra of a single object
is countably presented, and every nonzero algebra object has a
simple quotient.  Base change carries the splitting down, so a
single simple algebra splits the chosen object.

Over a simple algebra the regular module is a simple object of the
module category, and so is its twist by the odd line, so a free
mixed module is semisimple of finite length.  That is what will
carry the splitting from the tensor generator to every subquotient,
and with it to the whole category.

/-- **A simple algebra splitting a chosen object**, obtained from a
countably presented splitting algebra by passing to the quotient by
a maximal ideal.  The countably presented algebra above is kept,
together with the projection, because the dimension count for the
scalars of the quotient runs through it. -/

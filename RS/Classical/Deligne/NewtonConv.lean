# Convolution of complete homogeneous sequences

The complete homogeneous sequence of a sum of scalar sequences is the
convolution of the individual sequences: at the level of generating
series, `newtonHSeries (t + t') = newtonHSeries t * newtonHSeries t'`.

The proof follows the house technique: both sides satisfy the
first-order differential equation `F′ = (T + T′) · F` — the left by
the Newton derivative identity applied to the sum, the right by the
Leibniz rule and the identity applied twice — and both have constant
coefficient `1`, so they agree by the coefficient recursion that the
equation pins down.  A reusable uniqueness lemma
`odeUnique_of_constEq` packages the recursion argument.

Coefficient extraction yields the consumer-facing convolution formula
`newtonH_add`, together with its integer-indexed form `newtonHZ_add`
for Jacobi–Trudi consumers.

/-- **Uniqueness for `F′ = P · F`.**  Two power series satisfying the
same first-order linear differential equation with equal constant
coefficients are equal: the equation determines each coefficient from
the earlier ones by the recursion
`(n + 1) · F_{n+1} = ∑_{i+j=n} P_i · F_j`, and division by the
nonzero scalar `n + 1` closes the strong induction. -/

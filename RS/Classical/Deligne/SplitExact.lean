# Split short exact sequences and additive functors

A short exact sequence whose epimorphism admits a section is split,
and a split sequence stays split — hence short exact — under any
additive functor.  This is the mechanism by which the fibre functor
of `RS.Classical.Deligne.FibreAdditive` is seen to carry short exact
sequences to short exact sequences: base change produces a section
of the epimorphism, and the splitting is then transported by
additivity alone, with no exactness hypothesis on the functor.

Both steps are available in Mathlib.  The splitting induced by a
section is `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.Splitting.ofExactOfSection`,
which needs only a balanced preadditive category, and the transport
is `CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.Splitting.map` followed by
`CategoryTheory.ShortComplex.Splitting.shortExact`.  The three
two results below are the packaged forms used in this development,
naming the general statements at the shape in which they are
consumed.

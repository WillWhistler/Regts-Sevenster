# The scalars of a simple countably presented algebra are complex

The even part of the Γ-algebra of a simple algebra is a field, and a
quotient of a countably presented ind-object is countably presented,
so that field has countable dimension over the complex numbers.  A
field extension of the complex numbers of countable dimension is the
complex numbers, so every scalar is a complex multiple of the unit.

Together with the vanishing of the odd part this is exactly the pair
of hypotheses that `RS/Classical/Deligne/FreeSummand.lean` consumes:
the free-module functor is then full and faithful on the mixed
objects, and idempotents split with free image.

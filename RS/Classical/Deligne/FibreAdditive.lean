# The fibre functor is additive

Base change followed by realization is a functor from the ambient
category to the super modules over the Γ-algebra, and it is
additive: whiskering by the algebra is additive, and realization is
composition.  Additivity is what makes the fibre functor preserve
finite biproducts, and hence what turns a mixed sum into a free
super module of the corresponding rank.

The functor is built directly rather than as a composite through
the module objects, because the category of module objects carries
no additive structure in this development.

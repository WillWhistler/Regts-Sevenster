# ℂ-linearity of the embedding `C ⥤ Ind C`

For an *arbitrary* pair of ℂ-linear structures on `C` and on `Ind C`
the embedding `RS.indOf` need not be ℂ-linear: two ring maps
`ℂ → End (𝟙_ (Ind C))` can differ by a field automorphism of ℂ, and
nothing ties the structure upstairs to the one downstairs.  That is
why `RS.IndOfLinear` is carried as a hypothesis in
`RS.Classical.Deligne.GammaCountable`.

The structures this development actually installs are not arbitrary.
Both come from a single scalar unit `ψ : ℂ ≃+* End (𝟙_ C)`, by
`RS.linearOfScalarUnit ψ` downstairs and
`RS.linearOfScalarUnit (indScalarUnit ψ)` upstairs, and
`RS.indScalarUnit ψ` is by construction the transport of `ψ` along
the embedding and the unit comparison `RS.indOfUnitIso`
(`RS.indScalarUnit_apply`, which is a `rfl`).  For that pair the
scalar action on either side is conjugation of a unit endomorphism
through the left unitor, and the embedding is strong monoidal
(`RS.indOfMonoidal`), so it carries the one conjugate to the other:
this is `RS.indOf_map_scalarSmul`.

This file reads that transport in the language of the installed
module structures:

* `RS.indOf_linear` — `indOf.map (c • f) = c • indOf.map f` under the
  two `letI`-installed structures;
* `RS.indOfFunctorLinear` — the same, packaged as Mathlib's
  `CategoryTheory.Functor.Linear ℂ indOf`;
* `RS.indOfLinear_of_scalarUnit` — the same, in the shape
  `RS.IndOfLinear C` in which `RS.Classical.Deligne.GammaCountable`
  consumes it, so that the hypothesis is discharged for the scalar-unit
  structures.

The additive half is already available as `RS.indOf_additive`, so only
the scalar half is new here.  Note that no compatibility between `ψ`
and an ambient linear structure is asked, and no braiding is needed:
both actions are defined from the same `ψ`, and the proof uses only
the unitality of the strong monoidal structure of the embedding.

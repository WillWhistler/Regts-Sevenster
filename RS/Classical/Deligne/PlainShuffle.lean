# The plain diagonal shuffle and its equivariance

The diagonal shuffle `(X ⊗ Y) ^ ⊗ n ≅ X ^ ⊗ n ⊗ Y ^ ⊗ n` re-sorts a
tensor power of a tensor product: the empty power is the inverse
unitor, and each step of the recursion is the middle-four
interchange `tensorμ`, inverted by `tensorδ`.  The shuffle is
equivariant for the symmetric-group actions: the diagonal action of
a permutation on the `(X ⊗ Y)`-factors passes through it to the
simultaneous action on the two plain powers.

The isomorphism and its intertwining are carried by the distribution
isomorphism `tensorPowDistrib` of `Deligne/MixedDiag.lean`, whose
top-braiding square reduces to the componentwise braidings through
Mathlib's `tensor_associativity`, and whose functoriality follows
the recursions of `insertTop` and `permMor`.  This module presents
the shuffle under its own name, with the defining recursion
equations on both the forward and the inverse maps and the
equivariance statements in the form the plain tensor-power calculus
consumes.

/-- **The plain diagonal shuffle**
`(X ⊗ Y) ^ ⊗ n ≅ X ^ ⊗ n ⊗ Y ^ ⊗ n`: the empty power is the inverse
unitor, and each further step of the recursion is the middle-four
interchange `tensorμ`, inverted by `tensorδ`.  It is the
distribution isomorphism `tensorPowDistrib`, under the shuffle's
own name. -/

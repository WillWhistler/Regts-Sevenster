# Countable dimension of the Γ-algebra

The descent to the complex numbers of Deligne's Proposition 4.5
consumes a ℂ-point of the Γ-algebra of the universal algebra, and the
countable Nullstellensatz
(`RS.exists_algHom_of_countable_dimension`) supplies one as soon as
the even component has at most countable dimension.  This file
establishes that dimension count for the algebras built by the
tensor-product device of Deligne 2.11 over a countable index family.

The route is the compactness of the unit in the ind-completion.  The
big tensor product of a family of algebras is, by construction, the
filtered colimit of the finite sub-tensor-products
(`RS.bigTensor`), and a morphism out of the unit into a filtered
colimit factors through a stage
(`RS.exists_factor_of_unit_hom_colimit`).  So the even component
`𝟙 ⟶ bigTensor B` is the union of the images of the even components
of the stages; over a countable index family there are only countably
many stages, and a countable union of subspaces of at most countable
dimension has at most countable dimension.

The finite stages are the tensor words of the family, and they are
handled by the same one-variable colimit lemma.  Call an object of
the ind-completion *countably presented* (`RS.CountablyPresented`)
when it is a countable filtered colimit of embedded objects — the
precise sense of "built from countably much data".  Tensoring
preserves the colimits of the ind-completion, and the embedding is
monoidal, so a countably presented factor of a tensor word can be
absorbed one stage at a time
(`RS.rank_hom_unit_tensor_presented`), leaving tensor words against
an embedded object; those are finite dimensional by finite length
(`RS.finiteDimensional_hom_unit`).  Induction along the word
(`RS.rank_hom_unit_listTensor_le_aleph0`) needs no product of index
categories.

Two hypotheses are carried explicitly, because the ambient linear
structure on the ind-completion is itself a hypothesis of this
development and neither follows from it: ℂ-linearity of the
embedding `C ⥤ Ind C` (`RS.IndOfLinear`), and finite length of every
object of `C`.

The conclusion is packaged three ways: as a dimension count for the
common extension of a countable family
(`RS.exists_common_algebra_rank_le_aleph0_of_presented`), as the same
count for the universal algebra of Deligne 2.11 over countable index
families (`RS.exists_universal_algebra_rank_le_aleph0`), and, through
the countable Nullstellensatz, as a ℂ-point of the Γ-algebra
(`RS.nonempty_superPoint_gammaAlgebra`).

/-! ## Countably presented ind-objects

An object of the ind-completion built from countably much data is a
countable filtered colimit of embedded objects.  Such objects are
absorbed one at a time into a tensor word: tensoring preserves
filtered colimits of the ind-completion
(`RS.tensorLeft_ind_preservesColimitsOfShape` and its right-hand
version), so a tensor word against a countably
presented factor is again a countable filtered colimit, whose stages
are tensor words against an *embedded* factor — and the embedding is
monoidal (`RS.indOfTensorIso`), so those stages absorb the factor
into the base category.  Iterating along the word never leaves the
one-variable colimit lemma, and no product of index categories is
needed. -/

/-! ## The Γ-algebra and its ℂ-point

The even component of the Γ-algebra of a commutative monoid object is
its even component as computed above, so the dimension count is a
count of `𝟙 ⟶ R`; and the countable Nullstellensatz turns it into a
ℂ-point of the Γ-algebra. -/

/-- **A super-commutative ℂ-algebra of at most countable dimension
has a ℂ-point.**  The odd-nil quotient is a nonzero commutative
ℂ-algebra of at most countable dimension, so
`RS.exists_algHom_of_countable_dimension` gives it a ℂ-algebra map to
ℂ, which pulls back to a point.  This is the countable-dimension
replacement for the finite-type hypothesis of
`RS.nonempty_superPoint`. -/

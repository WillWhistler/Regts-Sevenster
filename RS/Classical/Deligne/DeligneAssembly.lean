# Deligne's theorem assembled

`RS.deligne_theorem` proves `RS.DeligneTheoremStatement`
(*Catégories tensorielles*, Théorème 0.6).  It is
`RS.deligne_theorem_of_braided`, which assembles the statement from
`RS.BraidedFibreHypothesis` — that the fibre functor
`RS.deligneFibre` of a splitting algebra at a complex point is
symmetric monoidal — applied to `RS.braidedFibreHypothesis`, which
discharges it from `RS.nonempty_braided_deligneFibre`.

The route is not Deligne's.  His §4 obtains the passage from an
arbitrary nonzero algebra of scalars to ℂ by descent along a
faithfully flat `Isom⊗` torsor.  Here the tensor generator alone is
split and one passes to a quotient by a maximal ideal: over a simple
algebra the regular module and its twist by the odd line are simple
objects of the module category, so a free mixed module is semisimple
of finite length, the objects the algebra splits are closed under
subquotients, and the scalars are a field of countable dimension over
ℂ, hence ℂ.  This is the pattern of Coulembier, *Tannakian categories
in positive characteristic*, Duke Math. J. **169** (2020), Lemma
3.3.2(ii), with Lemmas 1.2.10 and 1.5.2.

* `RS.deligneTheoremStatement_of_small`
  ([SmallReduction.lean](SmallReduction.lean)) reduces the statement,
  which quantifies over essentially small categories, to the case of
  a genuinely small one.
* A tensor category need not contain an odd line, so the small
  category is replaced by its ℤ/2-graded doubling, whose
  ind-completion carries the odd line `RS.doubledIndOddLine`
  ([Prop21General.lean](Prop21General.lean)).
* `RS.exists_splitting_simple_algebra_doubled`
  ([DoubledSplit.lean](DoubledSplit.lean)) produces the simple
  commutative algebra of the ind-completion of the doubling that
  splits every embedded object into a mixed sum of copies of the unit
  and of the odd line, together with a complex point of its
  Γ-algebra.
* Simplicity supplies the sections that exactness of the fibre
  functor consumes.  An embedded short exact sequence has an
  epimorphic right-hand map, so the free-module functor sends it to
  an epimorphism (`RS.epi_freeModMap`), and over a simple algebra
  every epimorphism out of a free mixed module splits
  (`RS.exists_section_of_simple`,
  [SimpleSplit.lean](SimpleSplit.lean)).
* `RS.deligneFibreFunctorOfPoint` collects `RS.deligneFibre` and its
  properties into a `RS.DeligneFibreFunctor`; the ℂ-linear clause is
  `RS.superVectFunctor_linear` fed by `RS.fibreFun_linear` and
  `RS.indOfFunctorLinear`.
* `RS.DeligneFibreFunctor.precompose` restricts the fibre functor of
  the doubling along the even embedding, which is strong braided
  monoidal, exact, faithful and ℂ-linear.

One compatibility is needed for the last step.  The even embedding is
ℂ-linear for the structure the doubling inherits componentwise from
its base, whereas the fibre construction runs at the structure induced
by the scalar unit, `RS.linearOfScalarUnit`.  The two agree:
`RS.scalarSmul_scalarUnitEquiv` identifies the scalar action of a
scalar unit with the ambient action in a monoidally ℂ-linear category,
and `RS.evenEmbedLinear_scalarUnit` reads that off for the even
embedding.

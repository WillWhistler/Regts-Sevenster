# Deligne's Proposition 2.1 without an odd line

`RS.exists_fibre_functor` produces the fibre algebra and its fibre
functor for a category whose ind-completion already carries an odd
line.  A tensor category need not contain such an object; Deligne's
device is to pass to the ℤ/2-graded doubling, which always does,
and to restrict along the even embedding.

This module runs that device.  The doubling of a small abelian
rigid symmetric monoidal ℂ-linear category with scalar unit
endomorphisms and moderate length growth inherits every one of those
hypotheses, and its ind-completion carries the image of the odd line
`RS.doubledOddLine` under the embedding.  Proposition 2.1 upstairs
therefore applies, and the resulting fibre functor restricts along
the even embedding `A ⥤ Doubled A`, which is strong braided
monoidal, exact and faithful; each of the four conclusions composes.

The hypothesis of 2.1 — that every object is killed by some Schur
functor — is supplied by the growth dichotomy
`RS.forall_exists_schurKilled`, applied to the doubling.

/-- **Deligne's Proposition 2.1 in general**: no odd line is
assumed.  The category is doubled, Proposition 2.1 runs on the
doubling — whose ind-completion carries an odd line — and the fibre
functor obtained there is restricted along the even embedding.  The
composite is strong monoidal, preserves finite limits and finite
colimits, and is faithful. -/

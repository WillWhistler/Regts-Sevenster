# The orbit count is the number of orbits

`orbitCount` is defined as the number of cycles plus the number of
fixed points, which is convenient for computing signs but says
nothing directly about orbits.  This file identifies it with the
cardinality of the quotient by "lies on the same cycle": an orbit is
either the support of one of the permutation's cycles or a single
fixed point, and those two possibilities are exclusive and
exhaustive.

That identification is what lets two orbit counts be compared when
their underlying sets are different — a walk on flags against a
rotation on labels, say — since a bijection of quotients is then
enough.

/-! ### Transporting orbits along a step-wise map

A map that moves each point within a single orbit of the target
permutation carries orbits to orbits, whatever it does inside them.
This is how a contracted matching's rotation is compared with the
original's: one step of the contracted rotation is several steps of
the original.

Grouping the ground set by orbit is what lets a construction be

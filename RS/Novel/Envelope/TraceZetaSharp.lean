# The trace-zeta theorem with the sharp threshold

The accompanying paper's Theorem A.1 in tower form, with the
appendix's own hypothesis on dimensions and its own threshold: for a
tower whose dimensions satisfy `finrank (E n) ≤ A ^ n`, and for
*every* integer `s > 2e√A`, the trace zeta function of every element
is `P/Q` with `P` and `Q` coprime, of constant term `1`, and of
degree at most `s − 1` (`traceZeta_rational_sharp`); equivalently the
power traces are a difference of power sums of two disjoint multisets
of nonzero complex numbers of sizes at most `s − 1`
(`traceZeta_superSpectrum_sharp`).

The appendix begins with a rigid symmetric ℂ-linear category and an
object `Z`, and derives the symmetric-group action on `Z ^ ⊗ n`, the
propagation of vanishing, the traces and the Frobenius identity from
the trace calculus.  A `FrobeniusTower` assumes exactly those as an
interface, and `ObjectTower.lean` constructs one from an arbitrary
category-and-object pair, so `traceZeta_rational_of_object` is A.1
in the appendix's own generality; the skein endomorphism algebras
instantiate the interface directly (`SkeinTower.lean`,
`BlockAssembly.lean`).

`TraceZeta.lean` proves the same conclusions over an arbitrary Schur
package but with the side existentially quantified, which is what the
forward proof consumes.  The sharpness is in the quantifier and in
the constant: here every admissible side gives its own degree bound,
and the threshold is stated in the growth constant itself.

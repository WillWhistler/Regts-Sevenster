# The quantitative trace-zeta theorem

In a Frobenius tower, the trace zeta function of every element is
rational with numerator and denominator degrees bounded by the hook
parameter.  This combines hook confinement (dead shapes outside a hook)
with the Frobenius identity (turning dead shapes into Schur vanishing)
and the rationality/super-spectrum engines from `ZetaRational` and
`HookVanishing`.

The side is existentially quantified here, and the package is
arbitrary — which is what the forward proof consumes.
`TraceZetaSharp.lean` states the same conclusions in the appendix's
own generality: a real dimension bound and every side above
`2e√A`.

Unlike `NilpotentTrace`, no nilpotency hypothesis is needed: the
hook-vanishing half of the proof uses only the Frobenius identity and
hook confinement, both of which hold for every element.

# Hook confinement

A `PermTower` over a family of algebras `E n` is a family of
representations of the symmetric-group algebras with exponentially
bounded dimensions (`finrank (E n) ≤ A ^ n`, the accompanying
paper's hypothesis, with `A` a real constant) in which vanishing
propagates along the standard embeddings.  The main theorem:
relative to any `SchurPackage`, the shapes alive in a tower are
confined to a hook — there is an `s` with every alive shape
satisfying `IsInHook (s − 1) (s − 1)`.

The argument: the square shape of side `s`, for `s` given by the
package's `square_dim` growth field at `⌈√A⌉`, has a block too large
for the tower's dimension bound, so it is dead
(`dim_sq_le_finrank`); by `e_killed_of_contained` and vanishing
propagation no shape containing the square is alive; and a shape
outside the hook contains the square.

# The super-symmetric form on one leg

The ambient space of the Gram construction is `V_k ⊕ V_{2ℓ}`,
carrying the symmetric form `xᵀy` on the even summand, the
skew-symmetric form `xᵀJy` on the odd summand with

    J = [[0, I], [-I, 0]],

and zero across the two.  This file is that form and nothing else,
written from the definition rather than assembled out of the
partition function's own weights, so that its relation to those
weights is a theorem.

The relation is recorded at the end: on the even block the form is
the partition function's state factor, and on the odd block it is
that factor negated.  The negation is the one already visible in
the tower's colour kernel, which pairs the odd colours through
`-oddThroughFactor`.

The through-edge state factor of the mixed partition function is
the super form on the even block and its negative on the odd one.
Both are recorded as theorems; nothing below assumes them.

/-! ### The dual basis at outgoing ends

RS21 writes the boundary vector at an odd leg as `f_c` where the
arc is incoming and `g_c` where it is outgoing, and computes
`⟨f_c, g_c⟩ = -1` and `⟨g_c, f_c⟩ = 1`.  In one basis, `g_c` is the
symplectic dual of `f_c`: the partner colour carrying the partner
sign.  The two displayed values are recovered below, which is what
fixes the convention.

/-! ### The through-edge factor is the dual basis at one end

A through-edge's two legs carry `f_{φ(a)}` and `g_{φ(a)}` — the
same colour, dual bases.  In one basis that says the two legs'
colours are partners and the leg holding `g` contributes its
partner sign.  The mixed partition function's through-edge factor
says exactly that, so it is the dual basis's contribution at those
legs rather than an extra weight.

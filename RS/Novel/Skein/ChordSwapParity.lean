# Chord re-pairing parity: the bridge and the crossing table

Three pieces of pure order-combinatorics glue on top of the two
coexisting crossing predicates:

* the **bridge** between the cut-style predicate `CrossesCut`
  (`ChordParity.lean`) and the chord-style predicate
  `ChordPairCross` (`PathLedger.lean`), under the normalization
  hypotheses of `chordPairCross_iff_xor`;
* the **mutual-crossing table** for four strictly ordered points in
  `ChordPairCross` vocabulary — parallel and nested chords do not
  cross, interleaved chords do;
* the **summed transfer**: over a finite family of normalized third
  chords avoiding the four points, re-pairing two chords preserves
  the total crossing parity (`third_chord_reparity` per element).

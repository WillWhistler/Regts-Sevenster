# The gluing-splitting interface

The through-independence input (choice elimination for the
corrected constrained value) and the single-pair gluing
decomposition, stated as named interfaces: gluing two boundary
labels decomposes the corrected state-constrained value as a state
sum over the glued interface, weighted by the through-state factor.
The unsigned through-independence is refuted in
`ThroughIndCFalse.lean`; what the development uses in its place is
the signed path-canonical value of `PathCanon.lean`, whose
within-pairing independence is `PropThreeOpen.lean`.

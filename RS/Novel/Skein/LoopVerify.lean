# A repaired system carrying a path-canonical orientation

The worked one-vertex fragment `TransposeVerify` (internal flags
`0–3`, boundary flags `4–7`) has three perfect matchings of its
internal flags.  This module builds the second of them as a repair
of the first, `lvKappa₂R = cKappa.repair 0 1 2 3`, together with an
orientation `lvO₂flip` of it: the one obtained from `cO` by
flipping the boundary chain `5–1–3–6`.

Against the fixed functional `cFunctional`, supported on the colour
set `{0, 5, 2, 7}` adapted to `cO`, that orientation's constrained
summand is `0` (`lvSummand₂flip`): the flipped in-list carries the
colours `{0, 7, 1, 6}` instead.  The summand is computed through
`lvThroughSummand`, which is `cThroughSummand` with the functional
freed so that each orientation can be evaluated against its own
delta.

`ThroughIndCFalse` uses exactly this: `cKappa` and `lvKappa₂R` both
carry path-canonical orientations with trivial chord sign, yet the
summands are `−1` and `0`, so the canonical value depends on the
boundary pairing and independence can only be asserted within one.

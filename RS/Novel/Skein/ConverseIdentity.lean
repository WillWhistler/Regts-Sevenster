# The super-Gram identity

The closing display of the proof of RS21's Theorem 6, in the form
the converse consumes: the composition's mixed partition function
is the superform pairing of the two fragments' tensors.  The base
sum the composition's own total equals is
`EdgeSubset.baseSumBitsOf_all` of `ConverseFamily.lean`, read with
the bits each subset itself determines, and the tensor side of that
sum is `EdgeSubset.base_sum_eq_superForm_pairing_bitsOf`.

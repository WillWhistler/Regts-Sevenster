# The corrected independence interface is refutable across pairings

`ThroughIndependenceC` quantifies over *all* pairs of transition
systems, including pairs with different boundary pairings.  On the
worked one-vertex instance the two matchings `cKappa` (chords
`(0,1), (2,3)`) and its repair (chords `(0,3), (1,2)`) both carry
path-canonical orientations (`cO`, `lvO₂flip`), both with trivial
chord sign, yet the constrained summands differ: `−1` versus `0`.
The canonical value genuinely depends on the boundary pairing —
Proposition 3 for open fragments can only assert independence
*within* a pairing (`signedValueAt_samePairing`), and the
interfaces consuming `ThroughIndependenceC` must be re-based on
the pairing-resolved value.

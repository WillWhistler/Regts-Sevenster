# The composition's own sum

At the composition there are no labels left: the through-edge product
is one and the agreement is vacuous, so the flag model's summand is
RS21's colouring sum times the circuit sign.  This file names that
sign as a weight on the composition's subsets and reads the
constrained partition value as the weighted sum the iteration
carries.

/-! ## The composition's value, read on the base

Putting the composition's own sum together with the iteration: the
constrained value of a composition is the base's summands, summed
over its subsets and over the interface colours, with the two
fragments' own free circles in front.  The composition's extra
circles — one for each closing cut — are exactly the iteration's
factor.

# The super form on boundary states, and the rank it bounds

A boundary state at arity `t` is a coordinate of the `t`-fold tensor
power of `V_k ⊕ V_{2ℓ}`, so a vector in that power is a function on
boundary states.  The ambient bilinear form is the `t`-fold product
of the super form on one leg: the identity on the even colours and
the symplectic form on the odd ones, zero across the two.  That one
leg's form is the through-edge state factor the mixed partition
function already uses.

Writing the connection pairing as this form evaluated at vectors
attached to the two fragments bounds the edge-rank by `(k + 2ℓ)^t`,
because that is how many boundary states there are.

/-! ### The fragment tensor's normalisation

The super form pairs an odd leg's two colours antisymmetrically, so
across the legs a matched pair of fragments picks up `(-1)` once for
each of the half of the used legs where the first fragment's arc
enters.  The fragment tensor carries a fourth root of unity per two
used legs, and the two fragments' roots multiply to exactly that
sign.  Since a leg is used exactly when its colour is odd, the
factor depends on the boundary state alone.

`⟨f_c, g_c⟩ = -1`; at the other half it leaves and the form is
`⟨g_c, f_c⟩ = 1`.  So the legs contribute `(-1)` to half the number

/-! ### The form is diagonal in the partner pairing

RS21 pairs two fragments' tensors coordinate by coordinate and
observes that the pairing vanishes unless the two coordinates agree
— the even colours outright, and the odd ones because the two
orientations are opposite at a used leg, so the same colour appears
against its dual basis vector.

Written in one basis the second coordinate is not equal to the
first but *dual* to it: the same colour on an even leg, the partner
colour on an odd one.  So the form has exactly one nonzero
coordinate for each state, and the double sum over coordinates
collapses to a single one.

/-! ### The leg bracket

At a used leg the two fragments each contribute a dual-basis weight
and the form contributes its entry.  Their product is RS21's leg
value: `-1` where the first fragment's arc leaves the leg and `1`
where it enters — provided the two arcs point oppositely, which is
what the Eulerian condition on the union of the two matchings says.

Each fragment's dual-basis weight is a product over the legs, so the
whole leg contribution is a product of brackets.  With the two
matchings' arcs opposite at every leg, each bracket is `-1` exactly
where the first fragment's arc leaves, so the product is `(-1)` to
the number of such legs — half the used ones, which is RS21's
count.

RS21's leg sign — provided the tensors are supported where the used
legs are the same, which is what (16) already says.

The two fragments each carry their own arc directions; they need
only be opposite at the legs both subsets use, since an even leg's
weight is one either way. -/

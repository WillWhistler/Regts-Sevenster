# Glossary

Recurring vocabulary of the development, for auditors.

* **Fragment** — a finite multigraph in half-edge (flag) form over
  a boundary-label type, with a fixed-point-free edge involution
  (`pairing`), a distinguished flag at each boundary label
  (`boundaryFlag`), and a separate free-circle count.
* **Closed fragment** — a fragment over `Fin 0`: a plain
  multigraph with free circles.
* **Gluing** (`gluePair`) — joining the half-edges at two boundary
  labels: the closing case makes a free circle, the rewiring case
  unifies two edges end to end.
* **Composition** (`Fragment.compose`) — gluing the last `t`
  labels of an `(s + t)`-fragment to the first `t` of a
  `(t + u)`-fragment, top pair first.
* **Strand bundle** (`strandBundle t`) — `t` parallel edges, the
  identity fragments.
* **Edge subset** (`EdgeSubset`) — a pairing-closed set of flags;
  **Eulerian** when every vertex meets it in an even number of
  flags.
* **Transition system** (`TransitionSystem`) — the local pairing
  `κ` of Definition 5: a fixed-point-free vertex-preserving
  involution of the participating flags.  Its **walk permutation**
  composes `κ` with the edge pairing; each geometric circuit
  carries two walk-orbits (its directions), whence the **circuit
  count**.
* **Mixed functional** (`MixedFunctional`) — the `(k, 2ℓ)` vertex
  data of a mixed partition function: values on multisets of even
  colours and sets of odd colours, with antisymmetry supplied by
  the sorting-sign evaluator (`evalOdd`).
* **Mixed partition function** (`mixedPartition`,
  `IsMixedPartitionFunction`) — Definition 5 on the flag model:
  the sum over Eulerian edge subsets of circuit-signed colouring
  sums against a `(k, 2ℓ)` vertex functional, with the
  `(k − 2ℓ)^{circles}` free-circle convention.  The bounded form
  (`IsMixedPartitionFunctionBounded`) additionally pins `k` and
  `2ℓ` below a stated bound.
* **Connection pairing / edge rank** — the closure pairing of a
  parameter at arity `t`.  `EdgeRankBounded f R` says every arity's
  pairing has rank at most `R ^ t`, rank being the dimension of the
  row span; the literature's reading — the supremum of the ranks of
  the finite submatrices of the connection matrix — is the same
  condition (`SubmatrixRankBounded`,
  `edgeRankBounded_iff_submatrixRank`).  The hypothesis class
  (`EdgeRankParameter`) packages the bound with normalization at
  the empty graph and isomorphism invariance.
* **Relative transition system** (`RelTransitionSystem`) — the
  open-fragment analogue: an involution of the *internal*
  participating flags; boundary flags start **boundary chains**,
  whose end-to-end matching is the **path matching** (`pathMatch`)
  and whose label pairs form the **chord diagram**
  (`labelChords`, a faithful pairing invariant).
* **Chord sign / path sign** (`pathSign`) — `(−1)` to the number
  of interleaving chord pairs of the boundary pairing; a function
  of the diagram alone.
* **Canonical frame** (`PathCanonical`) — the orientation class
  directing every boundary chain low-label-to-high; the **chain
  direction observable** (`chainDir`) equals high-status on it,
  and any orientation re-canonicalizes by whole-chain flips
  (`exists_recanonicalize`) at the cost of symplectic signs and
  odd-partner state relabels (`stateOddFlipSet`).
* **Repair** (`repair`) — the elementary 2-opt re-pairing move;
  non-localized repairs transpose the boundary pairing
  (`pathMatch_repair_swap`), and the pairing fibre is connected by
  π-returning blocks (`pairingConnectivity`).
* **The pairing-fibre ledger** (`pairedLedger`) — open-sector
  Proposition 3: across every π-returning repair block the
  `pathSign`-weighted canonical summand is preserved, so the
  signed canonical value (`signedValueAt`) depends on the boundary
  pairing alone.  Independence *across* pairings is false
  (`not_throughIndependenceC`), which is why the value is
  pairing-resolved.
* **The diagram gluing** (`glueChords`) — the Temperley–Lieb
  concatenation of a label chord diagram at a cut, whose crossing
  parity change is `diagCrossCount_glue_cross`: the chord-sign
  ratio the participating-cut splitting carries.
* **The interface lift** (`liftData`, `pushData`, `bitsOf`) — a
  family of transition data carried up the gluing interface one
  cut at a time and back down again.  A closing cut leaves the
  lift a free bit, since a glued subset has two lifts; read with
  the bits a subset itself determines (`bitsOf`), the round trip
  returns the family up to matching equality.
* **The pair family** (`pairFamily`) — a datum at every subset of
  the composition's base carrying RS21's (13) and (14) at once:
  the pair term as the composition's signed colouring sum, the
  pairing flipping along every interface edge, and the alternation
  across every interface pair that step 1 asks for.
* **The in-set at a vertex** (`relInSetAt`) — the participating
  flags attached to a vertex and marked incoming by a relative
  orientation, of which `relInFlagsAt` is the sorted enumeration.
  Each carries an **incoming sign** (`inSign`); flipping the
  colours on a set negates the sign exactly there, which makes the
  flip analysis a product of independent local factors.
* **The cut factor** (`cutFactor`) — the free circles a subset's
  own closing cuts contribute: `k` where the subset leaves a
  closing cut's edge out and `−2ℓ` where it carries it, the two
  sectors of the circle the glue creates
  (`edgeTermAt_pushData_colourSum`).
* **Tensor power** (`tensorPow A X n`) — `X ^ ⊗ n`, bracketed to
  the left, so that `X ^ ⊗ (n + 1)` is `X ^ ⊗ n ⊗ X` definitionally
  and the recursions below step one factor at a time.
* **The permutation action** (`swapTop`, `insertTop`, `permMor`,
  `permAlg`) — `swapTop` braids the last two factors, `insertTop`
  bubbles the top factor down, `permMor` routes each factor to the
  slot its permutation names, and `permAlg` is the resulting
  representation of the symmetric-group algebra.
* **The tensor power of an endomorphism** (`powHom X g n`) — `g`
  acting on every factor.
* **Categorical trace** (`catTrace`, `catDim`, `ptr`) — close a
  strand into a loop through the pairing of an object with its dual;
  `catDim` is the trace of the identity, and `ptr` closes the last
  factor only, leaving the rest open.
* **The block splitting** (`splitPow`, `blockSum`) — the
  reassociation `X ^ ⊗ (p + q) ≅ X ^ ⊗ p ⊗ X ^ ⊗ q` and the
  permutation acting on the two blocks independently.
* **Bounded length** (`LengthLE Y k`) — the subobject order of `Y`
  has no strictly increasing chain of `k + 2` terms; equivalently
  the composition length of `Y` is at most `k`.
* **Inputs** — `DeligneTheoremStatement` (Deligne 2002,
  Théorème 0.6, the single cited input, carrying Deligne's own
  hypotheses: essentially small, abelian, ℂ-linear, rigid
  symmetric, `End 𝟙 = ℂ`, finitely ⊗-generated, of moderate length
  growth.  Those are discharged for the concrete envelope.  Two
  things are taken from the theorem rather than all of it, each
  weakening the assumption: one direction of Deligne's equivalence,
  and its conclusion in fibre-functor form (`DeligneFibreFunctor`)
  rather than the ⊗-equivalence with the representations of a
  supergroup — and of that functor only the symmetric monoidal
  ℂ-linear part is consumed, as `DelignePackage`).
  `SchurPackage` and `EulerianIndependence` also name statements,
  but both are theorems of this tree (`schurPackage`,
  `eulerianIndependence`), and the converse
  (`regts_sevenster_converse`) rests on no input at all.
